# Python Hundred Days of code
 I am trying to learn Python, so that I can try to make some of the repetative daily tasks a bit easier.
 
 So I thought the best thing to do would be do the 100 days of code challenge.
 
 I went to Udemy and found a course which supports just that, [100 days of code - Angela Yu](https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/)
